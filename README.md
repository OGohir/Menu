This is a code that I wrote in order for the program to save a list

## Project Overview

  The goal of this project is to implement an online List saving program

    - Start the code
    - Add items, by typing out which item you want from the list, by first picking the number.
    - Once added, the user can type "3." to exit
    - The program reveals a "receipt" when typed "2", of the list.

## Project Goals

  This function will take the user's input and store it in a list If the item is not correctly spelled, or incorrect in any way, the code will stop working.

  **Preconditions:**
      - item can NOT be an negative integer
      - items MUST be spelled correctly
      - "3" will give the final output

## Future Improvements

  **1. Remove Items:** 
    - Introduce a remove items feature, as the customer cannot remove an item they wrote.
    
  **3. Add More Options:**
    - Realistically add greater options for products instead of adding varities of one.
